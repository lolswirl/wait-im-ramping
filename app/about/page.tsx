                hi, i'm swirl :) i'm a gamer and software engineer who enjoys the mathematical side of the world, which translates directly into digging into how healing works across different games, mostly aligned with world of warcraft. i've been playing wow since cataclysm, and started maining mistweaver monk in mists of pandaria.

              is a site full of tools to help world of warcraft healers plan, visualize, and fine-tune their healing. it includes various components such as a ramp timer calculator, a spell timeline visualizer, many tools that compare spells and cooldowns (that i've implemented :p), and much more.

              honestly, i started this website as a way to learn react which turned into much more: a method to share useful info for planning and optimizing healing - whether you're trying to clean up your sequencing, or satiate the desire to understand your spells a bit better.
